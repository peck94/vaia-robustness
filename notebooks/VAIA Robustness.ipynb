    "A straightforward idea for defense is **data augmentation**: simply expand the data set to include adversarial examples, so the model will learn to be robust to them the same way it learns everything else. An important design decision to implement this strategy is the specific choice of adversarial attack(s) on which to train. In particular, if the attack is *white-box* (as the strongest attacks often are), the generated adversarials will depend on the model parameters. Even if the attack is not white-box and does not need access to the model parameters, it might still be randomized and hence give different results for different runs on the same data.\n",

(2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03994.pdf). The strategy is extremely efficient and peculiar because *it's literally just fast gradient sign*, the very method we dismissed as ineffective earlier!\n",

    "1. The method does not start at the original inputs, but applies some random noise to them first.\n",

    "One major issue with adversarial training is that it only offers *empirical* robustness. In general, there is no way to know whether an adversarially trained model will be robust to *unseen* or *adaptive* attacks. Indeed, many defenses have been broken precisely because they failed to account for new attacks and only optimized robustness on existing ones. In some sense, this is inevitable: we can only verify robustness on attacks that we know.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, it would be useful if we had *provable* or *certified* defenses: defenses which can guarantee mathematically that no adversarial samples exist *at all* within the given threat model. This implies that no adversarial attack, no matter how strong, could possibly find any adversarial examples provided the threat model is respected. Such methods do exist, but as you can probably imagine, certification doesn't come for free: often, certified defenses require considerably more computational resources than uncertified ones, and they tend to be empirically *less* robust than adversarially trained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular certified defense methods is **randomized smoothing** ([Cohen et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02918.pdf)). It has several attractive properties that other certified defenses tend to lack:\n",

    "Adding JPEG compression to adversarially perturbed samples does not seem to help much at all. However, for some reason, many papers (including most notably [Guo et al. (2018)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyJ7ClWCb)) proposed it as an effective defense... What's going on here?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the issue here, we need to delve into the precise attack methodology used by prior work to assess robustness. Specifically, most works (including Guo et al. (2018)) applied a \"model-agnostic\" attack which did not take into account the details of the original model. Essentially, what they did was this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take an existing accurate model $f$.\n",
    "2. Add JPEG compression (or some other transformation) as a pre-processing step to $f$, obtaining a defended model $h$.\n",
    "3. Attack $h$ directly with existing attacks such as FGSM or BIM.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, we generated adversarial examples for $f$ (the original, undefended model) and fed those to the defended model $h$. This is known as a **transfer attack**, where the adversarial examples are not generated for the victim directly but rather for a different \"surrogate\" model. These attacks are useful when you don't know the precise details of the model you're attacking, but in particular transfer attacks are also really good at beating JPEG compression and other pre-processing based defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method of using transfer attacks to bypass defenses like JPEG compression was famously introduced by [Athalye et al. (2018)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/athalye18a/athalye18a.pdf). They attributed the failure of direct attacks to a phenomenon called **gradient masking**. As the name implies, gradient masking occurs when a model (intentionally or not) distorts its own gradient information. This can happen when the model incorporates non-differentiable or numerically unstable operations, such as JPEG compression. Such operations thwart adversarial attacks that crucially rely on this information, such as fast gradient sign and the basic iterative method. We can visualize this phenomenon using the loss surface of the model. A model that does not mask gradients will have a loss surface that looks like this:\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The surface is very smooth, and simply following the direction of the gradient will eventually allow you to reach a different class, thus possibly resulting in an adversarial example. When a model is masking gradients, however, we get this picture:\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss surface is essentially unchanged, but it has become much more irregular, with many additional valleys and peaks that complicate the landscape. If you simply follow the direction of the gradient to find an adversarial, you will likely get stuck in a local optimum with no obvious way to progress. This situation can be easily remedied, however, via all sorts of simple tricks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Approximating the gradient using numerical techniques such as finite differences instead of automatic differentiation.\n",
    "* Randomly sampling around the input to smooth out the loss surface.\n",
    "* Using more sophisticated optimization methods that incorporate momentum.\n",
    "* Replacing non-differentiable components of the model by differentiable approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Famously, by applying these simple tricks, Athalye et al. completely broke 6 out of 9 defenses submitted to ICLR 2018 before the conference even took place!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to appreciate the tempting and highly intuitive, yet ultimately fallacious, reasoning that underpinned the early \"successful\" defenses against adversarial examples. Goodfellow et al. based their FGSM defense on the **linearity hypothesis**, the idea that adversarial examples are caused by excessive linearity of the models in the vicinity of natural data points. Hence, the accepted wisdom at the time was that we merely needed to penalize linear behavior in order to get rid of adversarials. Most of the published defenses between 2014 and 2018 focussed on this idea and simply proposed different ways to efficiently penalize linear behavior. JPEG compression is one example of this: because the compression step is not differentiable, gradient-based attacks applied to the defended model will fail since there's no useful gradient information left after compression. As we have seen, however, this doesn't actually make the model robust: it can still be easily fooled if we just ignore the compression layer.\n",

    "In a sense, the adversarial machine learning community was \"overfitting\" on the FGSM and similar attacks that fundamentally operated on simple transformations of the loss gradient. More sophisticated attacks, such as those proposed by [Carlini & Wagner (2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04644.pdf) or Athalye et al., could easily evade such defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the efforts of Athalye et al., the adversarial ML community learned an important lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Always evaluate against *adaptive* adversaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing the effectiveness of a defense, it is not enough to show that the defense works against *known, existing* attacks; one must also take into account new attacks that are specifically designed to circumvent the defense you're using. This can require considerable creativity, but it is absolutely necessary to ensure that the defense has any merit."

    "A natural question to ask is whether robustness to *adversarial* perturbations (which are, in some sense, \"worst-case\") also provides robustness to *common* perturbations such as random noise, blurring, fog and other physical distortions. To evaluate the robustness of classifiers to such common corruptions, the CIFAR-10-C (\"corrupted\") was proposed by [Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJz6tiCqYm). As the name implies, this data set is comprised of samples from CIFAR-10 which have been subjected to all sorts of realistic corruptions models might actually face in reality.\n",

    "## Practical guidelines and key take-aways\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost: **always consider whether adversarial robustness is really worth it, because it might not be**. Increasing robustness generally comes at the cost of lower accuracy and higher computational overhead both during training as well as at inference time. Moreover, increasing *adversarial* robustness often also entails lowering robustness to other, more realistic corruptions such as random noise. Consider these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is there a realistic scenario where an adversary might use adversarial examples to manipulate the system? Often (but certainly not always!), if an attacker has the level of access required to introduce adversarial examples into your system, would it not be easier for them to just install some ransomware instead?\n",
    "* If there is a realistic scenario, are there other ways of dealing with this problem? In self-driving cars, for example, adversarial attacks can be thwarted by using other sources of information such as GPS and LIDAR. Mission-critical systems should in general have multiple layers of security and redundancies. Machine learning models already have significant probabilities of error in the benign setting, so even in the absence of adversaries you should not exclusively rely on a single model.\n",
    "* If adversarial examples cause you to question the general reliability of the model, consider resorting to explainable AI techniques, more diverse data sets and more thorough evaluations before deployment. Maybe look at methods which improve model calibration, such as [MixUp](https://keras.io/examples/vision/mixup/) and [Dirichlet calibration](https://github.com/dirichletcal/dirichletcal.github.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you *do* decide it is worth it, the following guidelines can be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Avoid creating your own defense.** The vast majority of reasonable ideas for adversarial defense have already been tried and have been shown to fail. Getting these defenses right is extremely hard, so it is best to stick with tried-and-true methods that have been publicly verified by many researchers over many years. A similar guideline is widely accepted within the field of cryptography, where it has come to be known as [Schneier's Law](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Anyone can invent a security system that they themselves cannot break. When someone hands you a security system and says, “I believe this is secure,” the first thing you have to ask is, “Who the hell are you?” Show me what you’ve broken to demonstrate that your assertion of the system’s security means something.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reliable source for effective defenses is the [RobustBench leaderboard](https://robustbench.github.io/#leaderboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decide on a **threat model**. Typical threat models include $L_p$ norms with $p \\in \\{ 2, \\infty \\}$ and patch attacks. Patch attacks are considered to be more realistic, and specialized defenses against these attacks are often better than defenses against $L_p$ attacks ([Levine & Feizei (2020)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/47ce0875420b2dbacfc5535f94e68433-Paper.pdf)). A reasonable estimate of the adversary's \"budget\" (i.e., the size of the $L_p$ perturbation, maximum dimensions of the patch, etc) is highly specific to the problem, however. Keep in mind that defending against a stronger adversary will likely mean creating a more complicated model with lower accuracy, so you will have to strike a balance.\n",
    "* **Adversarial training** remains the most efficient and effective general-purpose defense method. Most new defenses incorporate adversarial training in some way, so use this as your starting point. [The adversarial robustness toolbox](https://adversarial-robustness-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/defences/trainer.html) provides a flexible interface for applying adversarial training to any model.\n",
    "* Always use **early stopping** on the robust accuracy of a held-out validation set with adversarial training, otherwise overfitting is almost guaranteed to occur. [Rice et al. (2020)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/rice20a/rice20a.pdf)\n",
    "* Combine adversarial training with [model weight averaging](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/optimizers/MovingAverage) and data augmentation techniques such as [CutMix](https://keras.io/examples/vision/cutmix/), [MixUp](https://keras.io/examples/vision/mixup/) and [AugMix](https://github.com/google-research/augmix). [Rebuffi et al. (2021)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=kgVJBBThdSZ)\n",
    "* Incorporating **artificial data** created by generative models also helps. [Gowal et al. (2021)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=0NXUSlb6oEu)\n",
    "* **Unlabeled data** can also be leveraged using the simple scheme of *self-training* to improve robustness. [Carmon et al. (2019)](https://github.com/yaircarmon/semisup-adv)\n",
    "* Use the **[AutoAttack library](https://github.com/fra31/auto-attack)** (included with [RobustBench](https://robustbench.github.io)) to evaluate robustness. Do not forget to run AutoAttack with `version='rand'`, otherwise the result may be misleading in case of randomized defenses and gradient masking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common pitfalls to watch out for when performing a robustness evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Iterative attacks should perform better than single-step attacks.\n",
    "* Increasing the attack budget should strictly increase success rate. In particular, for sufficiently strong attacks (such as $L_p$ perturbations with unbounded norm), the success rate should be 100%.\n",
    "* Random sampling should not perform better than adversarial attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of the above criteria seem to be violated, this is a strong indication that the robustness you measured on your model is misleading. This could be due to e.g. gradient masking or incorrectly implemented adversarial attacks."
